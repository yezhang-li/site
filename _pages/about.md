Yezhang Li is currently a PhD student in Computational Fluid Dynamics (Ocean Modelling) supervised by Prof. [Matthew Piggott](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.d.piggott) at Imperial College London. He received the MSc degree in Applied Computational Science and Engineering from Imperial College London in 2023, and the BSc degree in Mathematics & Applied Mathematics from the University of Liverpool and Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in 2022.

He has been working on the formation and evolution of star clusters, and the 3D morphology and kinematical dynamics of open clusters by machine learning neural network and mathematical modelling for two years since 2020. After that he worked on numerical simulation for ocean acoustics based on the Helmholtz equations and numerical verification of the dynamic models of 3-DOF robot arm based on recognition of spatial coordinates in 2022. He has cross-disciplinary interests in numerical modelling and development of PDEs solver. He current main focus is on developing the unstructured mesh methods based on [Thetis](https://thetisproject.org) and [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org), combining with statistical techniques and uncertainty quantification to solve the fluid dynamic problems.
