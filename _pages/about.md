Yezhang Li is currently a PhD student in Computational Fluid Dynamics (Ocean Modelling) supervised by Prof. [Matthew Piggott](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.d.piggott) at Imperial College London. He received the MSc degree in Applied Computational Science and Engineering from Imperial College London in 2023, and the BSc degree in Mathematics & Applied Mathematics from the University of Liverpool and Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in 2022.

He has been working on the formation and evolution of star clusters, and the 3D morphology and kinematical dynamics of open clusters by machine learning neural network and mathematical modelling for two years since 2020, and then worked on numerical simulation for ocean acoustics based on the Helmholtz equations in 2022. He has cross-disciplinary interests in development of PDEs solver. He current main focus is on developing the unstructured mesh methods based on [Thetis](https://thetisproject.org) and [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org), and combine with statistical techniques and uncertainty quantification to solve the fluid dynamic problems.

Research Interests
======
Past research experience:
* Probing the Structure of the Milky Way Galaxy via open clusters
* The formation and evolution of star cluster in the Solar neighborhood
* Data reduction of Gaia DR2 / DR3 via machine learning neural network (Self-Organizing Maps)

Current research aspiration:
* Development of advanced numerical modelling based on the unstructured meshes
* Accuracy -- cost analysis for test cases based on shallow water equations
